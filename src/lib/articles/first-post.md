## Introduction

Hey there, dear reader. This articles serves as the entry point for me in the blogging world.

In this article, I will cover :

-   Who I am
-   Why I am starting to blog
-   What I will cover in future articles

## Who am I

I'm Sajidur Rahman, a student based in Switzerland and currently studying at the [EPTM of Sion, Valais](https://eptm.ch).
I'm following the classes to become a software developer later on.

My hobbies include drawing and international politics.

## Why am I starting to blog

Well.. _that's a great question_. Mostly to practise my writing skills, but also to help people with future articles related to tech.

## What I will cover in future articles

I primarily use [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev) as my full-stack framework, but I often find myself using [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com)
as a backend server. My favorite database is PostgreSQL, although I have played around with MySQL, MongoDB and Cassandra.

So my articles will mostly talk about these. However, I'm always open to learn and might post about new experiences as well.

## Conclusion

Well, that's it for today.

Although it was a short one, I hope to see you around for my next articles, in which I'll try to improve my writing skills and help you with something.

Bye ðŸ‘‹
