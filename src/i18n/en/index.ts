                    question: 'Why do I need a website ?',

                },
                two: {
                    question: 'How can a website help my business grow ?',
                    answer: 'Websites attract potential customers 24/7, provide valuable information, and create a trustworthy online presence. You can reach audiences well beyond your local market, improve customer communication, and even automate tasks such as scheduling or processing orders.'

                three: {
                    question: 'What are the key elements of a successful website ?',
                    answer: 'A good website should be fast, easy to navigate, and pleasant to view on all screens, including smartphones. Information should be clear and well-presented, and the site should be secure to protect visitors.'

                four: {
                    question: 'Can I use a free website builder ?',
                    answer: "Yes, you can use a free builder, but there are often limitations. The design will be less unique, you might have ads on your site, and you'll have less control over what you can do. A custom site allows you to have something that truly represents you and can grow with your business."

                    question: 'How much does it cost to create a website ?',
                    answer: "The cost of a website depends on what you want. A basic informational site is quite affordable, while a more elaborate site, like an online store, will cost more. It's an investment that varies based on your needs and budget."

                six: {
                    question: "What do I need to do to maintain my website after it's built ?",
                    answer: 'After your site is created, itâ€™s important to regularly update it, check for security issues to avoid problems, and manage the content to keep it current and relevant. Many people opt for a maintenance plan to ensure everything is handled efficiently and without hassle.'
